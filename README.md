# FuelToken
Fuel token is an experimental token that rewards hash power to miner of the block chain proportional to the difficulty of the block. 
This is interesting, especially with ASIC compatible hashing functions as the difficulty is proportional to the number of hashes that went into finding a block, and the number of hashes is proportional to the energy spent by the miner with their devices. Each token thereby is proportional to energy and money spent into acquiring the token. This has much different economics from the main token reward for securing the block chain which stays constant as the difficulty of the network increases.
